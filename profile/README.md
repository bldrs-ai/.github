# Bldrs • Smarter Building Together

Welcome to the Bldrs GitHub organization.

We’re building open, browser-native tools that let engineers, designers, and builders collaborate with AI around 3D models with the same ease and intelligence that modern software teams enjoy.

## What We’re Building

### Share

[Share](https://github.com/bldrs-ai/Share) is a browser-based collaboration environment for sharing and exploring 3D engineering models.

- Instant share links for IFC and STEP
- Real-time navigation with your team
- Federated versioning inspired by modern software workflows
- No installs, no friction

We’re approaching v1.0 with our first full MVP and preparing the rollout of our Pro offering.

### Conway Engine

[Conway](https://github.com/bldrs-ai/conway) is a high-performance, WebAssembly-powered 3D engine optimized for engineering workflows.  This is the IFC/STEP engine behind Share.

Loads complex IFC, STEP, and open-standard models directly in the browser

- Fast, local execution for privacy and speed
- Lightweight, extensible, and open to integration
- This is the technical foundation for real-time collaboration and AI-driven model understanding.

### Smarter Building: Our AI Direction

We’re designing an AI that participates like a teammate rather than a tool.

That includes:

- answering model questions
- generating views, analyses, and checks
- helping teams explore alternatives
- translating natural language into engineering actions
- automating repetitive review workflows

Our vision is a design ecosystem where humans, AI, and open standards all collaborate in the same shared space.

### Why We’re Here on GitHub

We believe engineering workflows should evolve the way software development has:

- open standards
- transparent versioning
- lightweight collaboration
- automation and AI assistance
- portable, browser-first tools

GitHub is the natural home for these ideas, and our repos reflect our commitment to an open, interoperable future for engineering.

### Contributing

We welcome:

- issues and feature requests
- integrations with IFC/STEP workflows
- community discussions
- contributions that push open engineering forward
